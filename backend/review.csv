Ho scelto questa GPU per l'abbondanza di core tensor CUDA, dato che la uso principalmente per usare modelli AI piuttosto complessi. Nonostante non e' l'ammiraglia della generazione 40XX, riesce comunque a difendersi bene tenendo bassi i consumi ( cosa non banale ).

Best budget gaming mouse by Logitech.

I like its build quality. White color matte finish and rgb light customisation.

But in software there is some problem.
When pc is turned on its take sometime to 5 seconds ( for customization setting my profile ) . Its sensitivity is also good.

"5.0 out of 5 stars REVIEW AFTER 3 MONTHS OF USAGE.
Reviewed in India on 10 September 2021
Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
Alright, straight to the point. ive been using this masterpiece for more than 3 months now and id be more than obliged to share my experience with you guys. So, if you are looking to buy a good budget gaming mouse( around 1k to 2k) id a 100% recommend the logitech g102 lightsync. In this review ill cover all the pros and cons ive noticed after 3 months of usage and reading this might be fruitful for u :)

first, lets talk about its design:
its a plastic build(good quality) and weighs around 84g(pretty good imo). the primary(left) and secondary(right) mouse buttons are quite clicky and i cant help but fall in love with them. the middle moues button is cool too, nothing wrong with it. There is a DPI switch button right below the Middle mouse button and its an oval shape and it sounds pretty good too! you get two extra buttons on the left side of the mouse(forward and back) which u can customize to ur needs, actually, u can customize every single button to ur needs on the mouse with the help of the logitech software. The RGB is a solid 9/10 imo. You can customize it in so many ways that u just cant be creative enough with it. The wire is 2.1m in length and it isnt, braided, but it wont break of easily and is quite twistable.

now lets get to the gaming part:
i shouldve said this in design but if u have small-medium sized hands and love playing fps games, this is the mouse for u im ngl. The DPI is upto 8000 and u can customize the dpi switcher with ur own values. I dont know the exact factory values but i set mine to 800/2200/4400/8000. The software also has macros that let u make ur own macros and assign it to ur mouse buttons. i wont go more deep about macros because u can figure it out on ur own and the topic is too much to cover XD

IMPORTANT!: now a side not that u just cant miss, you guys prolly havent heard about a mouse's IPS(no im not talking about the ips panel of a monitor). IPS stands for inches per second, and the higher the ips the better. but now ur wondering what does higher ips really do? well for an experiment, if u have a super crappy office mouse, plug it into ur system and swipe it from the left of ur desk to the right real fast. you might see that halfway through the screen, the mouse stops and goes down/up. If you wanna do fast flicks in ur games, that wont be possible with low ips, but the g102 has enough ips that no matter how hard i swipe it, it dosent stop.

I think thats enough for the pros, lets get to the cons shall we?

cons:
1: as i said, the build quality is great, but its not so great that if u drop it off of 3 meters, the mouse would be scratchless. i dropped mine once from 2 meters of height and it had a really really small dent on the bottom left side. Even though it wasnt really a big deal, i was scared sh*tless but its all aight, i cant even see the dent now. but still, i hope u wont be dropping ur mouse anywhere

2: now this is a big one, the matte texture of this mouse is slowly turning glossy, but luckily, the process is super slow and after 3 months i barely notice it, although im sure after 1.5 years its gonna be noticeable.

well i cant think of any other cons cuz its such a great mouse and if ur on a tight budget, just blindly buy this, it will do u wonders.

HOPE I HELPED! MUCH LOVE, PEACE OUT <3",20,80,real,,

this is the best gaming wireless mouse i have ever seen with a very good and comfortable design, it have 0 to no latency . The mouse functions well and the clicks are so satisfying, it comes with two types of battery one i a AA socket other is a AAA socket i would recommend you to go with the AA battery it provides a lot of gaming time like around 250 hours per AA battery, dpi is very good and the dpi change button on the fron of the mouse is really helpful.

5.0 out of 5 stars Razer DeathAdder Essential: A Solid Choice for Budget-Conscious Gamers
Reviewed in India on 8 September 2024
Colour: BlackStyle Name: Deathadder EssentialPattern Name: WiredVerified Purchase
As a casual gamer on a budget, I was looking for a mouse that could deliver good performance without breaking the bank. The Razer DeathAdder Essential fit the bill perfectly.

Pros:

Comfortable Design: The ergonomic shape is comfortable for long gaming sessions, and the rubber side grips provide excellent traction.
Accurate Tracking: The 6400 DPI optical sensor ensures precise tracking, even during fast-paced gameplay.
Customizable Lighting: The single-color green LED lighting adds a nice touch of personalization.
Durable Build: The mouse feels solid and well-constructed, with durable materials and switches rated for up to 10 million clicks.
Affordable Price: The DeathAdder Essential offers excellent value for money, making it a great choice for budget-conscious gamers.
Cons:

No RGB Lighting: While the single-color lighting is nice, some gamers may prefer the more customizable RGB options available in higher-end models.
Basic Software: The Razer Synapse 3 software is relatively basic compared to other Razer mice, with limited customization options.
Overall, I'm very satisfied with the Razer DeathAdder Essential. It's a great mouse for casual gamers who want a comfortable, reliable, and affordable option. If you're looking for a budget-friendly gaming mouse that can deliver solid performance, I highly recommend the DeathAdder Essential.",5,95,real,,

I recently bought the smartwatch, and I’m quite impressed with it. The watch has a sleek design and works smoothly without any lag. The performance is great, and the battery life is also solid, lasting me through the day with ease. A standout feature is the calling capability, which works well and is convenient for quick calls without reaching for my phone. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and feature-packed smartwatch in this budget.

Initial feedback (and it remains the same after 1 month use) - Fantastic product. All Features work as per the spec. Battery backup very good. Easily will last a week if used without BT calling. Call clarity and volume as good as a phone!!
Stress indicator available in this brand only. Drink water reminder is useful. Steps count is accurate while walking. Black coloer Look wise very trendy and cool (I didnt expect this much in looks). It feels comfortable and light in hand. Motives to workout or walk.
Quickfire delivery by Amazon (prime). Thanks

Watch looks stylish and sophisticated. It took 15 days for me to receive this watch. When it came I was really excited but my excitement was short lived. Within 2 weeks of me using the watch the watch started acting up. Sometimes the steps don’t get recorded. Sometimes the steps get recorded till half of the day then the steps suddenly show was zero. Everytime I use the watch it shows the pairing option again, start, quick settings as If I’m using the watch for the first time. None of the settings on the watch screen work when I tap it.
